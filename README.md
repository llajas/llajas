### Hi there 👋<br><br>
I'm Lauren!<br>
- I'm a DevOps & [Site Reliability Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztIIcXNzMN4) 👨🏻‍💻 at IBM. 👁️🐝Ⓜ️<br>
- I'm from Shreveport, Lousiana⚜️ and I live, work and operate out of Austin, Texas.📍🏙️
- I got into tech around 2005, when I realized that my video game console was just "Another computer".🎮🖥️
- I've got several years experience working in Network Operation Centers, focusing on service monitoring and Major Incident Management across telco and datacenter environments.
- I got my start working on and managing Windows based systems as a teen👦, but nowadays I work primarily on OpenShift & Kubernetes. ⎈<br>
- I enjoy scripting and automation, namely in Bash⌨️ and lately Ruby💎, as well (and PowerShell, where needed).<br>
- Got a cool home automation you're using or want to implement? I'd love to see it.
- I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and share what [I've discovered](https://youtu.be/FdsCX8ccYXs?si=GvYOo2xXwQ3WPfTt&t=153) on my journey. 📚<br>
