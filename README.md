### Hi there 👋<br><br>

I'm Lauren!<br>
- I'm a DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer at IBM. 👨🏻‍💻<br>
- I work primarily on OpenShift, but I enjoy all things Kubernetes related. ⎈<br>
- I enjoy scripting and automation, namely in Bash⌨️ and lately Ruby💎, as well.
- I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and share what [I've discovered](https://youtu.be/FdsCX8ccYXs?si=GvYOo2xXwQ3WPfTt&t=153) on my journey. 📚<br>

PR's are welcome!! Feel free to reach out! You can find me on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/VDmS4ty2aS), usually lurking the '__#tech__' channel.
