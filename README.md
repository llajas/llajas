### Hi there 👋<br><br>

I'm Lauren.<br>
I'm a DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer at IBM.<br>
I work primarily on OpenShift, but I enjoy all things Kubernetes related.<br>
I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and share what [I've discovered](https://youtu.be/FdsCX8ccYXs?si=GvYOo2xXwQ3WPfTt&t=153) on the topic during my journey.<br>

Feel free to reach out! You can find me on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/VDmS4ty2aS), usually lurking the '__#tech__' channel.
