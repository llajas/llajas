### Hi there 👋<br><br>

I'm Lauren!<br>
- I'm a DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 at IBM. 👁️🐝Ⓜ️<br>
- I enjoy scripting and automation, namely in Bash⌨️ and lately Ruby💎, as well (and PowerShell, where needed).
- I got my start working on and managing Windows based systems as a kid, but nowadays I work primarily on OpenShift & Kubernetes. ⎈<br>
- Got a cool home automation you're using or want to implement? I'd love to see it.
- I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and share what [I've discovered](https://youtu.be/FdsCX8ccYXs?si=GvYOo2xXwQ3WPfTt&t=153) on my journey. 📚<br>
